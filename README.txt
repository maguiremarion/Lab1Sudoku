Notes:
Program centers primarily around solve() method, but runs enterBoard() first to accept entrance of the user input for the board to be solved.

solve() is a method that then calls other methods within the program to primarily perform verifications on whether a number can be placed within a cell. Once it runs through these methods and determines an answer, solve() is then recursively called.
